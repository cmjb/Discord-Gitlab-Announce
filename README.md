# Discord-Gitlab-Announce

This is a go microservice that takes in Gitlab header tokens and payloads and formats them into Discord messages.

 - `token` is the discord token for your bot.
 - `channel` is the discord channel for your bot to post in
 - `token_gitlab` is the token for Gitlab, which is sent via the gitlab header
